		"summary": "Developing and deploying secure software is a difficult task, one that is even harder when the developer has to be conscious of adhering to specific company security requirements. In order to facilitate this, different approaches have been elaborated over the years to varying degrees of success. To better understand the underlying issues, this paper describes and evaluates a number of static code analysis techniques and tools based on an example that illustrates prevalent software security challenges. The latter can be addressed by considering an approach that allows for the detection of security properties and their transformation into security policies that can be validated against security requirements. This would help the developer throughout the software development lifecycle and to insure the compliance with security specifications"

Different approaches have been proposed to facilitate this task, such as code analysis that aims at detecting flaws in the developed software before it is released and deployed to customer. This paper discusses a number of static code analysis approaches and presents different code analysis tools adopting each a specific analysis technique. These tools are evaluated against a sample code illustrating different security challenges that can be addressed using an approach that helps detecting security properties. The latter can be transformed into abstract security policies that can be validated against explicit security requirements. This would help the developer throughout the software development lifecycle and to ensure the compliance with security specifications."

		"summary": "The development and delivery of secure software is a challenging task, that gets even harder when the developer tries to adhere to both application and organization-specific security requirements translated into security guidelines. These guidelines serve as best practices or recommendations that help reduce application exposure to vulnerabilities, and provide hints about the application’s adherence to high-level and abstract security requirements. In this paper, we present guidelines we gathered from different sources, and we highlight the main issues related to the interpretation and application of those guidelines. We present a first attempt to classify the requirements with the objective of identifying the analysis that should be performed to verify the adherence of the developed software to each of the categories."
